## 🧠 Why I Built This

I'm a DJ who's been chasing that perfect flow between tracks since I started spinning. But Rekordbox and other DJ software just don't offer a clean way to **save and recall your favorite transitions**.

**TransitionsApp** is my way of capturing the magic — the energy — of those moments when two tracks just *work*. Now, I can build out my best transitions, track combinations, and future sets in one simple tool.

## ⚡️ Coming Soon

- Tagging by mood or energy  
- Rekordbox Integration (BPM and key detection, etc.)
